			"description" : "During the bubble economy of the 60s and 70s, Xizhi, a satellite city to Taipei, was densely over built. The uncontrolled growth resulted in an environment lacking in the qualities that define urban \u00E2\u0080\u0098livability.\u00E2\u0080\u0099 Minimal public facilities or open space and chaotic roadways severing the urban fabric resulted in a pedestrian unfriendly environment. The central area, housing 40,000 people in an area of 4 km X 2 km, will be the focus of the workshop. The purpose is to make Xizhi a livable and physically reconnected environment employing both temporal and permanent strategies. The challenge is to \u00E2\u0080\u009Cretrofit\u00E2\u0080\u009D this area, inserting spaces and functions into the existing urban fabric without massive clearing. Students submit a 1-page statement of interest and abbrevieated portfolio featuring one or two design projects. May also register under 11.957."

The robots are not autonomous; teams will be provided with wireless controllers to command their robots. The challenge is to produce the fastest running gaits and the deadliest fighting motions to compete against the other robots at a deathmatch.  Presentations provide brief reviews of the state of the art in humanoid robot control techniques, much like those of Honda\'s Asimo."

While prevention strategies are contested on the global political stage, the effects of climate change are already in motion. Rising ocean levels will transform landscapes and displace millions of people. In this three-week design research workshop, we will document and analyze five different grounds, each of which posits a different adaptive response to climate change-related flooding: Accumulate: raised ground, Drift: floating ground, Relocate: refugee ground, Loft: suspended ground, Harbor: protected ground. We will study how these five topographies of floodspace operate on the deltaic plains of Bangladesh. Our aim is to create a set of online visual essays that identify challenges and opportunities in proposing new ways to think about and design for floodspace habitation. Attendance at Nov. 20 informational meeting advised."

This January, the course outline will include: a general energy summary, discussion of traditional fossil fuels, nuclear energy, geothermal energy, and biofuels. There will also be local field trips during the January term to visit energy-related sites. Additionally, there will be an optional for-credit field trip during spring break (24-28 March 08) to sites (either in California or the Caribbean) where geothermal and wind energy are being produced on a large scale."

Many processes are sufficiently complex and involve so many parameters that physically based models cannot be readily constructed. Statistical approaches for their analysis will be demonstrated to characterize such systems. Concepts such as experimental error, design of experiments, and goodness of fit will be discussed. Lab experiments will be performed and analyzed to optimize a system using statistical design of experiments."

			"description" : "During the bubble economy of the 60s and 70s, Xizhi, a satellite city to Taipei, was densely over built. The uncontrolled growth resulted in an environment lacking in the qualities that define urban 'livability.' Minimal public facilities or open space and chaotic roadways severing the urban fabric resulted in a pedestrian unfriendly environment. The central area, housing 40,000 people in an area of 4 km X 2 km, will be the focus of the workshop. The purpose is to make Xizhi a livable and physically reconnected environment employing both temporal and permanent strategies. The challenge is to 'retrofit' this area, inserting spaces and functions into the existing urban fabric without massive clearing. Students submit a 1-page statement of interest and abbreviated portfolio featuring one or two design projects. May also register under 4.199."
